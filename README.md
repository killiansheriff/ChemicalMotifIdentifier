# ChemicalMotifIdentifier


This repository contains the codes necessary to perform a chemical-motif characterization of short-range order, as described in ``https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01545'' and ``link_to_follow''. 

This framework allows for correlating any per-atom property to their local chemical motif.

It also allows for the determining of predictive short-range chemical fluctuations length scale.

The framework is based on equivariant graph neural networks to ensure complete accuracy in the motif identification, any motifs that can be seen in a fcc, bcc or hcp solid solution with up to 5 chemical elements can be identified with 100% accuracy.
